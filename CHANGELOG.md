## 0.1.11

### Both platforms

- **[feature] Added `disabledModules` to `RollaSDKConfig` / `RollaConfiguration`.** Pass a set of `RollaDisabledModule` values to hide a module's UI surfaces. `weight` and `bloodPressure` are the first two modules supported for disabling; see `RollaDisabledModule` for the current list.

- **[breaking] Removed the previously undocumented `enabledModules` parameter from `RollaConfiguration`.** Replaced by `disabledModules`. Partners weren't using the old parameter, but anything that referenced it must switch to the new API.

## 0.1.10

### Both platforms

- **[feature] Added the `showSettingsButton` boolean config on `RollaConfiguration`.** Renders a Settings button on the Home screen that opens a sheet with Data Sources and Goals shortcuts. Defaults to `true` since most partners need it automatically.

- **[improvement] Improved the GPS tracking to be more accurate on iOS and Android.** The location pipeline has been refactored on both platforms to hold steady when you're standing still, filter out GPS zig-zags, and recover cleanly when you start moving again. Additionally, the in-app map views got some general UX improvements and polishing.

- **[documentation] Added a permissions rationale matrix to the iOS and Android permissions docs.** Each permission is grouped by capability (Location, Bluetooth, Health Connect / Apple Health, etc.) and carries a required/optional status plus a partner-ready rationale suitable for App Store and Play Console submissions.

### Android

- **[breaking] `minSdk` raised from 24 to 26.** Required by the bundled Health Connect plugin's manifest.

- **[breaking] Host-app Kotlin floor raised to 2.2.0.** Required by the bundled `health` plugin's transitive `kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:2.2.10`. Kotlin ≥ 2.1.0 should work as well because of the [version tolerance](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/metadata-jvm.html#maven) rule, but 2.2.0 is still the recommended minimum.

- **[feature] Google Health Connect support.** Android health data can now be synced and tracked from Health Connect.

- **[improvement] Build JDK floor lowered from 21 to 17.** AAR is now compiled with Java 17 (class file major version 61).

### iOS

- **[improvement] Simulator support added (Debug configuration).** `0.1.10` runs on iPhone simulators under the Debug configuration, in addition to the existing Release-on-device support. Hardware-backed features (Bluetooth, etc.) still only work on physical devices.
